### What each file is responsible for and why it exists

**`pim_core/config.py`**
Loads all environment variables at startup into a single `Settings` object. Every part of the application imports `settings` from here instead of calling `os.getenv()` directly. This gives one place to change, validate, and document all configuration.

**`pim_core/schemas/product.py`**
Defines the data contracts the entire system speaks. `Product` is what comes in from the PIM system. `BrandVoice` controls how the copy sounds. `DescriptionResult` is what the agent returns. Using Pydantic models here means FastAPI validates request bodies automatically and any invalid input is rejected before the LLM is ever called.

**`pim_core/llm/client.py`**
The only way any agent touches an LLM. It accepts a `model` name and delegates to the right provider. Agents never import providers directly — only `LLMClient`. This means you can change how providers work without touching agent code.

**`pim_core/llm/factory.py`**
Reads the model name prefix and returns the matching provider instance. Instances are cached in a module-level dict so each provider SDK is initialised only once per process. This is the factory pattern — callers ask for what they want by name, not by constructing it themselves.

**`pim_core/llm/registry.py`**
An in-memory map of `agent_name → model_name`. When the operator calls `POST /config/model`, the registry is updated. When the agent's workflow runs, it reads from the registry to find its current model. If no model has been set for an agent, it falls back to `settings.claude_model`. This is what makes model switching possible at runtime without restart.

**`pim_core/llm/providers/base.py`**
The abstract interface that all providers must satisfy. If a new provider is written (e.g. Mistral, Cohere), it must implement `complete()` with this exact signature. This enforces the contract so `LLMClient` can call any provider the same way.

**`pim_core/llm/providers/anthropic_provider.py`**
Wraps `anthropic.AsyncAnthropic`. Reads `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` from settings. Always imported — Claude is the default and always required.

**`pim_core/llm/providers/openai_provider.py`**
Wraps `openai.AsyncOpenAI`. Uses lazy imports — the `openai` package is not imported at startup. It is only imported when an agent is first switched to a GPT model. This means the service starts fine even if `openai` is not installed.

**`pim_core/llm/providers/google_provider.py`**
Wraps `google.generativeai`. Same lazy import pattern as OpenAI. Converts the shared message format into Gemini's format (role must be `"user"` or `"model"`, content goes in a `parts` array).

**`agents/product_description_generator/main.py`**
The FastAPI application entry point for the Content Agent. Mounts the model config router and defines the `POST /generate-description` endpoint. Thin — all logic lives in the tool and workflow layers below.

**`agents/product_description_generator/routes/model_config.py`**
Implements `GET /config/model` and `POST /config/model`. `GET` reads the current assignment from the registry. `POST` validates the model prefix is supported before writing to the registry. Returns `400` with a clear error if the prefix is unknown.

**`agents/product_description_generator/workflows/description_workflow.py`**
A LangGraph `StateGraph` with a single node: `generate_node`. This node reads the current model from the registry, builds the prompt, calls the LLM via `LLMClient`, and parses the JSON response. Errors are caught inside the node and stored in `state["error"]` rather than being raised — this keeps the graph always terminating cleanly.

**`agents/product_description_generator/tools/generate_description.py`**
A FastMCP tool that is the public entry point invoked by the FastAPI endpoint. It initialises the graph state, runs the graph with `ainvoke()`, checks for errors, and assembles the final `DescriptionResult`.

**`agents/product_description_generator/prompts/brand_voice.py`**
Pure functions that build the system prompt and user message from a `BrandVoice` and `Product`. No LLM calls here — just string assembly. Kept separate so prompts can be read, tested, and iterated on without touching the workflow.

---

## 7. Phase 1 — Content Agent (Product Description Generator)

### Goal

Build the Content Agent: a FastAPI microservice that accepts a product and brand voice configuration, runs a LangGraph orchestration graph, calls Claude, and returns a structured JSON description result.

### What was built

**Shared schemas (`pim_core/schemas/product.py`)**

Three Pydantic models define the data contract:
- `Product` — the product coming in from the PIM system (id, sku, name, category, attributes)
- `BrandVoice` — how the generated copy should sound (tone, keywords to include, words to avoid, length limits, locale)
- `DescriptionResult` — the structured output (title, description, seo_keywords, word_count, model_used)

**Prompt builders (`agents/product_description_generator/prompts/brand_voice.py`)**

Two pure functions:
- `get_system_prompt(brand_voice)` — builds the LLM system prompt. Tells the model it is a product copywriter, sets tone, length constraints, locale, and instructs it to respond only with valid JSON in a specific format.
- `get_user_message(product, channel)` — builds the user turn. Formats product attributes into a readable block and includes the target channel.

Keeping prompts in their own module means they can be iterated without touching the orchestration graph.

**LangGraph workflow (`agents/product_description_generator/workflows/description_workflow.py`)**

A `StateGraph` with one node (`generate_node`) and one edge to `END`. The state is a `TypedDict` carrying: product, channel, brand_voice, title, description, seo_keywords, and error.

`generate_node` does:
1. Reads the system prompt and user message from the prompt builders
2. Calls `llm_client.complete()` with the assembled messages
3. Parses the JSON response from the LLM
4. Returns the parsed fields, or sets `error` in the state if parsing fails

Errors are caught inside the node rather than raising mid-graph. This ensures the graph always reaches `END` cleanly — the caller checks `state["error"]` after the graph finishes.

**FastMCP tool (`agents/product_description_generator/tools/generate_description.py`)**

Wraps the graph in a FastMCP `@mcp.tool()` decorated function. Initialises the state dict, calls `description_graph.ainvoke(state)`, raises `ValueError` if `state["error"]` is set, otherwise assembles and returns `DescriptionResult`.

**FastAPI app (`agents/product_description_generator/main.py`)**

Exposes two endpoints:
- `GET /health` — liveness check
- `POST /generate-description` — accepts `GenerateDescriptionRequest` (product + channel + optional brand_voice), delegates to the tool, returns `DescriptionResult`

**Tests written in Phase 1 (34 tests):**
- `test_brand_voice.py` — 10 tests covering prompt builder output
- `test_description_workflow.py` — 4 tests covering graph node behaviour
- `test_generate_description_tool.py` — 4 tests covering tool integration
- `test_main.py` — 4 tests covering HTTP endpoints
- `test_config.py` — 3 tests covering settings
- `test_schemas.py` — 6 tests covering Pydantic models
- `test_llm_client.py` — 3 tests covering LLM client delegation

---

## 8. Phase 2 — Multi-LLM Provider Layer

### Goal

Remove the hard dependency on Claude. Let operators switch any agent to OpenAI GPT or Google Gemini at runtime via a REST API call, without restarting the service.

### Requirements

- One agent has exactly one model assigned at a time
- Multiple agents can share the same model
- The model assignment is changed via a dedicated API (`POST /config/model`)
- Switching takes effect on the next generate call, no restart required
- The service must start even if OpenAI or Google packages are not installed

### What was built

**`BaseLLMProvider` ABC (`pim_core/llm/providers/base.py`)**

An abstract base class with one abstract method: `complete(model, system, messages, max_tokens)`. This is the contract every provider must satisfy. By programming against this interface, `LLMClient` can call any provider identically.

**Three concrete providers**

`AnthropicProvider` wraps `anthropic.AsyncAnthropic`. It is always available (Anthropic is a hard dependency). Reads API key from `settings.anthropic_api_key`.

`OpenAIProvider` wraps `openai.AsyncOpenAI`. Uses lazy imports — `openai` is only imported inside `__init__`, which is only called when a GPT model is first requested. If the `openai` package is not installed, a clear `ImportError` with a `pip install` instruction is raised at that point. OpenAI's chat format requires the system prompt as the first message in the messages list, so the provider prepends it automatically.

`GoogleProvider` wraps `google.generativeai`. Same lazy import pattern. Gemini's API uses a different message format (`role` must be `"user"` or `"model"`, content goes in a `parts` array), so the provider converts the shared format before calling the SDK.

**Factory (`pim_core/llm/factory.py`)**

`get_provider(model_name)` routes by prefix:
- `claude-*` → `AnthropicProvider`
- `gpt-*`, `o1-*`, `o3-*`, `o4-*` → `OpenAIProvider`
- `gemini-*` → `GoogleProvider`
- anything else → `ValueError` with a clear message listing supported prefixes

Provider instances are cached in a module-level `_instances` dict. Each SDK client is created once and reused on every subsequent call. This avoids creating a new HTTP connection pool on every request.

**Registry (`pim_core/llm/registry.py`)**

`AgentModelRegistry` is a module-level singleton that holds a `dict[str, str]` mapping agent names to model names. It has four methods:
- `set(agent, model)` — assign a model to an agent
- `get(agent)` — return the assigned model, or fall back to `settings.claude_model`
- `all()` — snapshot of all current assignments
- `remove(agent)` — clear assignment (reverts to default)

The `get()` method imports `settings` lazily (inside the method body) to avoid circular imports at module load time.

**Refactored `LLMClient` (`pim_core/llm/client.py`)**

The client now delegates to the factory instead of constructing an `AsyncAnthropic` directly. It accepts an optional `model` parameter. If no model is passed, it falls back to `settings.claude_model`. This makes it provider-agnostic.

**Workflow update (`agents/product_description_generator/workflows/description_workflow.py`)**

`generate_node` now calls `agent_model_registry.get("content")` to discover its current model before calling the LLM. This is the line that connects the runtime registry to the LLM call.

**Model config router (`agents/product_description_generator/routes/model_config.py`)**

Two endpoints:
- `GET /config/model` — reads from `agent_model_registry.get("content")`
- `POST /config/model` — calls `get_provider(request.model)` to validate the prefix, then writes to `agent_model_registry.set("content", request.model)`

Validation happens before writing to the registry. If the prefix is unknown, a `400` is returned and the registry is not updated.

**Tests written in Phase 2 (14 new tests, 48 total):**
- `test_llm_factory.py` — 5 tests: Anthropic routing, OpenAI routing, Google routing, instance caching, unknown prefix error
- `test_llm_registry.py` — 5 tests: default fallback, set/get, multiple agents, all() snapshot, remove reverts to default
- `test_model_config.py` — 4 tests: GET returns default, POST stores model, POST persists for subsequent GET, POST rejects unknown prefix

## 10. Theory and References

### Design Patterns

**Strategy Pattern**

The core of the multi-LLM layer. `BaseLLMProvider` defines the interface (the strategy). Each provider (`AnthropicProvider`, `OpenAIProvider`, `GoogleProvider`) is a concrete strategy. `LLMClient` is the context — it holds no provider directly, it asks the factory for one. Swapping providers does not change any caller code.

> Reference: [Refactoring Guru — Strategy Pattern](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/strategy)

**Factory Pattern**

`get_provider(model_name)` in `factory.py` is a factory function. Callers say what they want (a model name) and the factory decides which class to instantiate. Callers never call `AnthropicProvider()` themselves. This is the Factory Method pattern applied as a plain function.

> Reference: [Refactoring Guru — Factory Method](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/factory-method)

**Singleton Pattern**

Three module-level singletons exist in this codebase:
- `settings` in `pim_core/config.py` — one config object per process
- `llm_client` in `pim_core/llm/client.py` — one client per process
- `agent_model_registry` in `pim_core/llm/registry.py` — one registry per process

Python modules are cached after first import, so a module-level variable is effectively a singleton.

> Reference: [Refactoring Guru — Singleton Pattern](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/singleton)

**Agent Pattern (Perceive → Plan → Act)**

Although Phase 1 has a single-node graph, the LangGraph `StateGraph` is already structured for the agent loop pattern. State flows through nodes; nodes perceive the current state, decide what to do, and produce new state. Future agents can add planning and tool-use nodes without changing the outer structure.

> Reference: [LangGraph — Concepts](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/)
> Reference: [ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models (Yao et al., 2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629)

---

### Concurrency Model

FastAPI is built on Starlette and runs in an async event loop (via `asyncio`). All LLM calls use `async/await` throughout:
- `LLMClient.complete()` is `async`
- All provider `complete()` methods are `async`
- The LangGraph graph is invoked with `ainvoke()` (the async version of `invoke()`)
- The FastAPI endpoint uses `async def`

This means a single worker process can handle many concurrent requests without blocking — while one request waits for a Claude API response, the event loop handles other requests.

> Reference: [FastAPI — Async and Await](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/async/)

---

### Prompt Engineering

The system prompt in `brand_voice.py` follows structured prompt design:
- **Role framing** — "You are a professional product copywriter specialising in e-commerce content" sets the model's persona before any instruction
- **Explicit output format** — the prompt instructs the model to respond only with valid JSON in a specific schema, making parsing reliable
- **Constraint injection** — tone, length limits, locale, keyword inclusions, and word exclusions are injected into the prompt from the `BrandVoice` config at runtime

> Reference: [OpenAI — Prompt Engineering Best Practices](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering)

---

### Testing Strategy

**Where to patch in Python tests**

A critical subtlety in the test suite: when a module does `from pim_core.llm.factory import get_provider`, Python creates a local name binding in that module's namespace. Patching `pim_core.llm.factory.get_provider` does not affect that local binding. You must patch the name where it is used: `agents.product_description_generator.routes.model_config.get_provider`.

This is documented in the Python standard library under "Where to Patch":

> Reference: [Python docs — unittest.mock: Where to Patch](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html#where-to-patch)

**Test isolation**

All LLM calls are mocked in tests using `unittest.mock`. No test makes a real API call. Provider constructors that check API keys are bypassed using `patch.object(ProviderClass, "__init__", return_value=None)` so tests focus on routing logic, not credentials.

> Reference: [pytest-asyncio documentation](https://pytest-asyncio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

---

### Lazy Imports

`OpenAIProvider` and `GoogleProvider` import their SDKs inside `__init__` rather than at module top-level. This is intentional:
- The `openai` and `google-generativeai` packages are not in `requirements.txt` as hard dependencies
- The service starts and runs Claude-only without them installed
- The import error (if the package is missing) is raised at the moment a user first tries to switch to that provider — with a clear `pip install` message — not at server startup

> Reference: [Python docs — Import system](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html)

---

### Pydantic Settings

`pydantic-settings` extends Pydantic to read configuration from environment variables and `.env` files. Fields are declared as typed class attributes. Required fields (no default) cause an immediate startup failure with a clear validation error if missing. Optional fields (typed as `T | None = None`) silently default to `None`.

> Reference: [pydantic-settings documentation](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/concepts/pydantic_settings/)

---

## 11. Running Tests

From inside `ai_agent_microservice/`:

```bash
# Run all 48 tests
venv/bin/python -m pytest -v

# Run only Content Agent tests
venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/product_description_generator/ -v

# Run only LLM layer tests
venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_llm_factory.py tests/test_llm_registry.py tests/test_llm_client.py -v

# Run with coverage report
venv/bin/python -m pytest --cov=. --cov-report=term-missing
```

Expected output: **48 passed**.

No real API calls are made during tests. All LLM interactions are mocked.

---

## 12. Knowledge Graph (graphify)

The project uses [graphify](https://github.com/safishamsi/graphify) to maintain a navigable knowledge graph of the entire codebase, documentation, and knowledge base. The graph lives in `graphify-out/` at the project root (one level above `ai_agent_microservice/`).

### What it produces

| Output file | What it is |
|---|---|
| `graphify-out/graph.html` | Interactive graph — open in any browser, no server needed |
| `graphify-out/graph.json` | Raw graph data for programmatic querying |
| `graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md` | Audit report: god nodes, surprising connections, suggested questions |

### Installation

graphify is a separate Python tool installed globally (not inside the project venv):

```bash
pip install graphifyy
```

Verify it installed correctly:

```bash
python3 -c "import graphify; print('ok')"
```

### Build the graph for the first time

Run from the **project root** (`pim_core_ai_agents/`), not from inside `ai_agent_microservice/`:

```bash
cd ..                  # move to pim_core_ai_agents/ if you're inside ai_agent_microservice/
/graphify .            # or: claude --skill graphify .
```

This scans all 65+ files (Python source, Markdown docs, PDFs, SVG diagrams), runs AST extraction on code files, and runs semantic extraction (via Claude) on documents. Outputs are written to `graphify-out/`.

### Update the graph after making changes

After editing files or adding new files:

```bash
/graphify . --update
```

graphify compares the current project state against its stored manifest and only re-extracts files that changed:

| Change type | Re-extraction needed | LLM call? |
|---|---|---|
| Python file modified | AST only | No |
| `.md` / `.txt` / `.pdf` added or changed | Semantic extraction | Yes (costs tokens) |
| File deleted | Ghost nodes pruned automatically | No |
| No changes since last run | Exits immediately with "Nothing to update" | No |

The manifest and extraction cache are stored in `graphify-out/`. Do not delete this folder between runs — it is what makes incremental updates fast and cheap.

### Full rebuild from scratch

Only needed if the graph has become significantly out of date or corrupted:

```bash
rm -rf graphify-out/
/graphify .
```

### Querying the graph

Once built, you can ask questions about the codebase directly:

```bash
/graphify query "how does model switching work"
/graphify query "what connects BrandVoice to the LLM call"
/graphify path "AgentModelRegistry" "AnthropicProvider"
/graphify explain "get_provider"
```

### Current graph stats

The graph as of the last run covers:

- **367 nodes** — code symbols, documentation concepts, design decisions, business signals
- **516 edges** — 66% extracted directly from source, 34% inferred by Claude
- **14 meaningful communities** — Content Agent Runtime, LLM Provider Layer, Model Config & Registry, Prompt Engineering, Agent Development Roadmap, Customer & Business Signals, and more
- **Top god nodes:** `BrandVoice` (20 edges), `Product` (19), `AgentModelRegistry` (17), `get_provider()` (12)

## 13. Shared vs Agent-Specific Code

> **Maintainer note:** Update this section every time a new agent is added or a new shared module is introduced in `pim_core/`.

Understanding what is shared and what is agent-specific is critical when adding new agents (Catalog, Procurement, etc.). The rule is simple: **if it lives in `pim_core/`, it belongs to everyone. If it lives in `agents/<name>/`, it belongs to that agent alone.**

---

### Shared — any agent can use this (`pim_core/`)

`pim_core/` is the shared foundation. No individual agent owns any file inside it. When you build a new agent, import from here — never from another agent's directory.

| File | What it provides |
|---|---|
| `pim_core/config.py` | `settings` singleton — API keys, default model name, environment, log level |
| `pim_core/schemas/product.py` | `Product`, `ProductAttributes`, `BrandVoice`, `DescriptionResult` — shared data contracts |
| `pim_core/llm/client.py` | `llm_client` — provider-agnostic async LLM caller. One line to call any LLM |
| `pim_core/llm/factory.py` | `get_provider(model_name)` — routes model name prefix to the correct provider instance |
| `pim_core/llm/registry.py` | `agent_model_registry` — runtime map of which LLM each agent is currently using |
| `pim_core/llm/providers/base.py` | `BaseLLMProvider` ABC — the interface every provider must implement |
| `pim_core/llm/providers/anthropic_provider.py` | Anthropic Claude provider (`claude-*` models) |
| `pim_core/llm/providers/openai_provider.py` | OpenAI provider (`gpt-*`, `o1-*`, `o3-*`, `o4-*` models) |
| `pim_core/llm/providers/google_provider.py` | Google Gemini provider (`gemini-*` models) |

---

### Product Description Generator only (`agents/product_description_generator/`)

Everything inside `agents/product_description_generator/` is exclusively owned by the Content Agent. No other agent should import from here.

| File | Why it is specific to this agent |
|---|---|
| `agents/product_description_generator/main.py` | This agent's own FastAPI application and HTTP server |
| `agents/product_description_generator/routes/model_config.py` | Model switching API scoped to the `"content"` agent name in the registry |
| `agents/product_description_generator/tools/generate_description.py` | The `generate_description` FastMCP tool — content-specific logic |
| `agents/product_description_generator/workflows/description_workflow.py` | LangGraph `StateGraph` wired for product description generation |
| `agents/product_description_generator/prompts/brand_voice.py` | Prompt builders using `BrandVoice` — specific to product copywriting |

### Rule for adding a new agent

When building `agents/catalog/` or `agents/procurement/`:

1. Create `agents/<name>/main.py` — its own FastAPI app
2. Create `agents/<name>/routes/model_config.py` — copy the pattern from `agents/product_description_generator/routes/model_config.py`, change `AGENT_NAME = "<name>"`
3. Create `agents/<name>/workflows/`, `tools/`, `prompts/` — agent-specific logic only
4. Import `llm_client`, `agent_model_registry`, `get_provider`, and all schemas from `pim_core/` — never from `agents/product_description_generator/`
5. Add new shared schemas to `pim_core/schemas/` if multiple agents will need them
6. Update this section of the README
